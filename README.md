Differential expression analysis of toxoplasma infected mice

## Notice:
The file path contained in the codes may no longer be available due to rearrangements, but in such case, explaination will be given in a markdown statment, with the new file path given/what content has been processed in the step. If any questions regarding the file path, please contact xiaoyue.deng@students.unibe.ch . 

### Overview of steps:
1. General Preparation: Directories of the files & Workspace
2. Quality check: fastqc and multiqc[R script](https://github.com/XiaoyueLenax/RNA_Sequencing_DEG/blob/main/2_Quality_Check)
3. HISAT2 mapping to reference genome
4. FeatureCounts
5. DESeq2 quality check
6. Differential expression analysis
7. Overrepresentation Analysis
Extra: result visualization & misc
